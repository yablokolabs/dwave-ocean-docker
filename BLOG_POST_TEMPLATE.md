## The Problem: Quantum Computing Setup Friction

Getting started with quantum computing shouldn't require a PhD in system administration. Yet too often, developers spend hours (or days) wrestling with:

- ❌ Complex dependency management
- ❌ Version compatibility issues  
- ❌ Platform-specific installation problems
- ❌ Missing quantum algorithm examples

We built this repository to eliminate that friction entirely.

## The Solution: Production-Ready Docker Environment

### What You Get

Our Docker environment includes:
- ✅ **Complete D-Wave Ocean SDK** - Latest stable version
- ✅ **Working examples** - QUBO, TSP, Max Cut, Ising models
- ✅ **Jupyter notebooks** - Interactive tutorials
- ✅ **Zero configuration** - One command setup

### Real-World Examples Included

**1. Traveling Salesman Problem**
```python
# Complete TSP implementation with BQM formulation
from dimod import BinaryQuadraticModel
from dwave.samplers import SimulatedAnnealingSampler

# Your quantum TSP solver in < 50 lines
```

**2. Portfolio Optimization**
```python
# Financial portfolio optimization using quantum annealing
# Perfect for fintech applications
```

**3. Maximum Cut Problems**
```python
# Graph partitioning for network analysis
# Applicable to social networks, logistics
```

## Getting Started (Seriously, It's 2 Commands)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yablokolabs/dwave-ocean-docker
cd dwave-ocean-docker && ./run_dwave_env.sh
```

That's it. You're now running quantum algorithms.
